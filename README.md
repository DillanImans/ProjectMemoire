### Project Features
\A mostly static site featuring a real online gift shop.\
----
### Project Characteristics
* Looks clean and simple (supposedly).
* Made with React & Redux (hence reusability and scaleable).
* "as of this commit", the project will always be improved and updated.
----
### Project Weaknesses
* One of the features can be written in one component, but have not.
* No smooth scrolling.
* Not responsive throughout all screen sizes (will be in the next commit).
----
### Personal Importance
My first ever React & Redux project outside of a course. Definitely a very simple one, 
but still one that has taught me a lot of things. I'll be updating and improving this site 
to finally make it a full-blown eCommerce site (if the owner of this business allows me to). 
Until then, Imma make more stuff.
