### Project Desc
A static site featuring an online gift shop.

----
### Project Characteristics
* Looks clean and simple (supposedly).
* Made with React & Redux.

----
### Project Weaknesses
* One of the features can be written in one component, but have not.
* No smooth scrolling.
* Not responsive throughout all screen sizes.
* What do you put in componentWillUnmount?
* Bottom Arrow wont go due to non-dynamic pixel calculation (aka I didn't write the code for all screens).

----
### Future Updates
No plan for any updates.

----
### Personal Importance
My first ever React & Redux project outside of a course. Definitely a very simple one, but still one that has taught me a lot of things. 
I'll be updating and improving this site to finally make it a full-blown eCommerce site (if the owner of this business allows me to). 
Until then, Imma make more stuff.
